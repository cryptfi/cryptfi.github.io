# An Introduction

Sites like [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) have been highlighting just how sloppy modern day companies are with security, your data is out there for the world to see. I decided i'd spend the ***day*** seeing what I could find, I admit I knew about some of these resources before hand, but alot of them I didn't.


# Free / Public Downloads

Perhaps the most well-known public and free download site for databases is [**databases**.***today***](https://databases.today), ran by the owner of [Snusbase](https://snusbase.com) a paid database lookup service.

They claim to be:

> #### "The biggest free-to-download collection of publicly available website databases for security researchers and journalists."

Through my searching I also came across what looks to be a rip-off of [**databases**.***today***](https://databases.today/), named [Nuclear Leaks](https://nuclearleaks.com/), following the same design and directory listing.

## Forums

There's a wide array of database sharing Forums, most of which are open to the Public, the largest seemingly being [RaidForums](https://raidforums.com/). They have an official list of leaked databases, which have been verified by the Forum owner, aswell as a section where anybody can post anything from their collection in return for an on-forum currency named 'Credits', which allow them to then buy other peoples shares.

Some runner up Forums being [DemonForums](https://demonforums.net/), [BreachForums](https://www.breachforums.com/) and [MoneyTeam](http://forums.money.team) all following the same type of on-forum currency idea.

## Incorrectly Setup Forums

There's a fair few Forums out there which are incorrectly setup and despite normally needing credits to see their hidden links you can just goto /misc.php?action=syndication on them then generate a link for the specific sub-section and view everything for free.

## CthulhuSec | Magnets

One of the most prominent Database sites used to be Cthulhu's, whilst it's now down, the magnet links for it are still going strong.

You can find a link to his torrent files [here](https://anonfiles.cc/file/7e835a8c55687d9a68bc90a849417f80).
You can find an old HTML page for everything [here](https://justpaste.it/13kcp) (Use web.archive.org to retrieve everything).

Both of these are courtesy of a user on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kapichurej/status/832123605643255810)

You can find CthulhuSec on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/cthlhusec)

If the links provided ever go down I have archives which I can link to.

## Breach Compilation

A Magnet link to a 41GB file appeared on reddit a few months back consisting of almost all Public Databases including Antipublic and Exploit.in. 

```

## Guron18 | Mail.ru

When looking around Forums I stumbled across a Russian one named antichat where a user by the name of Guron18 was linking to a cloud.mail.ru storage link full of Databases which didn't seem to be circulated on other websites.

It has a main folder with about 150 Databases in, and then another folder named 'HACK' with another 44 or so in. 

You can find the post [here](https://forum.antichat.ru/threads/442969/#post-4054501).
