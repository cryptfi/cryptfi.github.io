#### VPN’s:

You should be running the Tor Browser really, use a bridge if needed, also you can run Tor outside the browser without much technical experience. Just to be clear, I am not stating Tor is a VPN it’s far from it, VPN’s are for Privacy and Tor more for anonymity. I won’t get in-to the technical details of Tor, but if you want simple privacy use a VPN, if you’re looking for anonymity, use Tor.

In this section I will be linking to VPN providers, who are seemingly interested and or good at protecting your anonymity or privacy, please note these are two different things, Privacy and Anonymity should never be considered the same as they both contain completely different objectives.

#### [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/)  — 
Payment: They accept PayPal, Bitcoin, Credit Cards and alot more currencies, visit [https://nordvpn.com/pricing](https://nordvpn.com/pricing) to see the rest. It uses OpenVPN technology and also supports other protocols. They offer DoubleVPN servers, which route your traffic through one server in the Netherlands for example and then through another in Russia, this is supposed to protect against servers which are compromised. They also offer Tor Over VPN, P2P Servers, Dedicated IP and DDOS servers. A kill switch is built into the app and can be set easily, they are also offering a new feature named CyberSec, which can be toggled on or off it supposedly, ‘Blocks ads, protects you from malware, DDOS and other threats’ their words not mine. People have however had problems with their lack of support and speed fluctuations. Their company is based in Panama. As far as I can tell they do NOT have a warrant canary.

#### [iVPN](https://ivpn.net/)   — 
In their words ‘We accept all major credit cards, Paypal, Bitcoin and cash. However paying with cash is only available when purchasing an annual subscription.’ They also claim to not keep logs and claim they are not required to by law. They use a ‘VPN Firewall’, which prevents against IP Leaks or in their words ‘makes them impossible’. 

They have a warrant canary located [here](https://www.ivpn.net/resources/canary.txt) that is updated monthly and signed with their PGP that can be found [here](https://www.ivpn.net/resources/pubkey.txt). They’re located in Gibraltar.

#### [PerfectPrivacy](https://www.perfect-privacy.com/)  — 
They accept PayPal, Bitcoin, Cards and Cash. They have a No Logging policy and support OpenVPN, they have a ‘Multi VPN’ function, which “Cascades your VPN connection with up to four OpenVPN servers plus additional proxy and ssh tunnels.” They offer stealth VPN connections, which bypass VPN blocks, they also offer Tor on their servers. They’re based in Panama, they don’t have a warrant canary as far as I can tell.

#### [MullVad](https://www.mullvad.net/)  — 
They have a no-log policy, they accept Bitcoin and Cash, they don’t ask for an email, phone or any other identifying information to sign up they’re also pretty cheap. Based in Switzerland “Under current Swedish law there is no way for them to force us to secretly act against our users so a warrant canary would serve no purpose,” said Mullvad who are based in Sweden.”

#### [CryptoStorm](https://cryptostorm.is/) — 
Great VPN, their staff are knowledgeable and know their stuff, don’t be put off by the site (It’s not too nice looking in my opinion.), BTC is accepted, they have a no-logs policy and are based in Iceland.



#### XMPP’s:

[CockLi](https://cock.li/) — I am recommending this one based on Vincent’s {Owner} previous experience with dealing with Law Enforcement, I respect how he’s handled situations in the past. You can also expect this XMPP to not close down for a awhile.

[XMPP.IS](https://xmpp.is/)— Ran by a trusted user and has been running for several years, they offer different xmpp.* domains including .fi, you can also connect over their Tor Server.

#### Emails:

It goes without saying that you should be using something like PGP, however just remember that PGP is unique, PGP directly ties you to that Email, that’s why it’s better to use alternative ways of communicating.

[Protonmail.com](https://protonmail.com/) — Pretty obvious, anyone even slightly interested in InfoSec, OPSEC or Privacy knows about it now, it also has a Tor service, find it at protonmail.com/tor. Upside is it’s free.

[TutaNota](https://tutanota.com/) — Again free, pretty well known, offers different @Domains, downside is you can’t send emails from it without password protection, this could also be seen as an upside or a pain in the ass.

[Mailfence](https://mailfence.com/) — Mailfence reached out with more information regarding their site over Twitter and i've also decided to make an account. Singup is easy, however you'll need a pre-existing email for verification, they say "All encryption operations take place in the browser making it a “true” end-to-end encrypted email solution." Based in Belgium they offer 500mb of space on their free plan and accept Bitcoin to upgrade. [More information here.](https://blog.mailfence.com/about-mailfence/)

[EasyCrypt](https://easycrypt.co/) — Again, I have barely used this service but i’ve heard good things, it’s also free.

[Disroot](https://disroot.org) - They offer a wide variety of services including mail, most their stuff is ran off opensource software and they're based in the Netherlands. Offering the most space out of all at 4GB.

[Riseup](https://riseup.net/) — If you don’t know riseup then you’re living under a rock, free, but invite only at the moment.

[NeoMailbox](https://www.neomailbox.com/) — Based in Switzerland and unlike the others is paid, it has built in encryption and accepts Bitcoin.

#### Messengers:

[Signal](https://whispersystems.org/) — E2EE encrypted chats, they offer both Mobile and Desktop clients, personal information will be needed to signup.

#### Encrypted Stuff:

[SpiderOak ](https://spideroak.com/)— I personally don’t have any experience with spider oak, but from what i’ve read it seems to encrypt things on the client side and has a ‘Zero Knowledge’ type policy.

[Veracrypt](https://veracrypt.fr/) — It’s an upgraded version of TrueCrypt, you can create encrypted partitions, full disk encryption is also possible you can also just encrypt something like a flash drive.

[GPG4WIN](https://www.gpg4win.org/) — File and Email encryption, this is for Windows only, it goes without saying that Windows isn’t generally good for Privacy anyway.

[LUKS - Linux Unified Key System](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/) - Cryptsetup and LUKS - open-source disk encryption.
